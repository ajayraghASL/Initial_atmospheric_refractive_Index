# Initial_atmospheric_refractive_Index

### Octave code for creating a sample atmospheric column of dimension 10*25 from sea level to an altitude of 20 km above sea level.
### The equations used in the code are obtained from : https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-P.453-11-201507-S/en
### The variation in temperature with altitude is taken according the variation of temperature in Indian regions, (  Compared to ISA, the Indian reference atmosphere is 15 degree celsius warmer at low altitudes) : https://www.ias.ac.in/article/fulltext/reso/013/10/0971-0977  
### Note: we are assuming the vapor pressure to be the saturation vapor pressure for the given pressure and temperature at that altitude.
